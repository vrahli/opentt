## Agnostic Extensional Type Theory

A parameterized extensional type theory parameterized by a choice
operator, interpreted by a forcing interpretation parameterized by a
modality. Modalities can be instantiated by bar spaces, capturing
standard Beth models. Parameters can be instantiated so as to obtain
either a classical or a intuitionsitic theory.
