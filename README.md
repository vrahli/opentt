## An Agnostic Extensional Type Theory

A parameterized extensional type theory parameterized by a choice
operator, and interpreted by a forcing interpretation parameterized by
a modality. The choice operator can for example be instantiated by
free-choice sequences or references. Modalities can be instantiated by
bar spaces, capturing standard Beth models. Parameters can be
instantiated so as to obtain either a classical or a intuitionsitic
theory.
